**Node Instructions**

**Creating a new module**
1. Inside the main folder, create a "myModule".js
2. In the node use "module.exports" = variable

**Import modules into the JS**
This is where the function will call on a specific node.
    - example: const variable = require('./myModule.js')
    - example: const fs = require('fs')

**Building a new Node/NPM Project**
1. Go to Terminal
2. Create a "Main" Folder to store the file
3. Type `npm "name of the package"' to install the node
4. Create a ".gitignore" file
    - in the gitignore file type "node_modules" to ignore most of the files

1. Go to your terminal
2. Go to your main folder where you want to clone into
3. Enter `git clone "url link of the fork code" 
4. After you clone it, go to the main folder in terminal
5. Enter `npm install` to install the npm
